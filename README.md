# Hotel-Predictive-Analysis
Using hotel data to predict revenue, occupancy, etc throughout the coming years


Displayed:
- keymetrics which a hotel owner would want to see (revenue, occupancy, RevPar,etc)

Questions:
- They want to look into pricing of rooms
- It was noticed in the key metrics trend graph we saw a flat line for the ADR. This shows that the hotel has flat/static pricing; it is not fynamic pricings. This means this hotel does not change the hotel proces based on demand such as during holidays and weekends.
- flat pricing, weekend/weekday pricing, dynmaic pricing: three types of pricing used by hotels

1. Why is my business not doing well
2. Checking occupancy levels. Do we have enough occupants based on the number of rooms we have?
3. If occupancy doesnt seem to be an issue then you go further and check the pricing strategy the hotel is using to understand why the revenue isn't growing. W
hat pricing strategy is the hotel using?

Rating/reviews can also affect how people view and pick this hotel to book. How do the ratings of the hotel affect the revenue of the hotel? 
- seems to be that hotels with lower ratings correlate to lower reveneue and occupancy

Another trend noticed on realisation% and ADR% by platform chart, could be the platform which is being used to book the hotels 
- hotels should offer the best prices on their own hotel website because it has the lowest commission, but they can run extra promotions such as 5% off your next purchase extra
- Similar to how external sites such as expedia or booking.com do when they offer packages with flights and hotels combined by dropping the price of each a little
